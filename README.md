# Youfone for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant integration allowing to monitor your Youfone usage

```text
In order to avoid IP blacklisting / DDOS identification, the update interval is set to a minimum of 2 hours (you can increase it in the configuration).
When Home Assistant restarts, it will fetch the data from the local storage and it will update the sensors after the configured interval.
When adding a hub of the integration, it might take 1 minute to complete the addition, due to a 5 seconds interval set between each API call to Youfone.
```

### Features

- ðŸ“± Mobile data sensors
- ðŸ“ž Voice & sms sensors

### Disable debug logging and download logs

Once you enable debug logging, you ideally need to make the error happen. Run your automation, change up your device or whatever was giving you an error and then come back and disable Debug Logging. Disabling debug logging is the same as enabling, but now you will see Disable Debug Logging. After you disable debug logging, it will automatically prompt you to download your log file. Please provide this logfile.
